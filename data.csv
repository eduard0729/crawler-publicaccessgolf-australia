,Mornington and Bellarine Peninsula,Thirteenth Beach – The Creek Course,"The Creek Course is characterised by gently undulating couch fairways, huge, deep bunkers filled with yellow sand, and by firm true greens surrounded by interesting bumps, swales and hollows, all closely mown, as well as plenty of greenside bunkering that cuts into and helps mould the slopes of the putting surfaces in the best traditions of Melbourne’s Sand Belt  much admired by Faldo, who has spoken previously of his love affair with Mackenzie’s work at Royal Melbourne.,The native couch fairways have been oversewn with fescues, and this should provide both an excellent, green playing surface year round, and a quick transition back to couch dominance in spring.  Beyond the fairways there is generally a wide zone of maintained short rough prior to either long pasture grasses or the residential areas under development.,There are some quirky elements too, like the ‘square cut’ tees, the creek itself, and the creative use of a few remaining pines in hole strategy","Barwon Heads Road, Barwon Heads, VIC 3227"
 (03) 5254 2922 ,Mornington and Bellarine Peninsula,Thirteenth Beach – The Beach Course,"The Beach Course set tongues wagging when it opened for play in December of 2001. Players lucky enough to experience the golf course in its infancy, were treated to a raw and immature beast. Long rough, firm and fast greens, and the formidable presence of mother nature all contributing to make the scoring of par a difficult task. In just two months the course was already rated amongst Australia’s best coming in at number 22 in Golf Australia’s top 100 golf courses. Since then the golf course has only improved. The rough and the greens have been tamed making the golf course more playable for everybody, yet still a tremendous challenge for even the best of players. Good play is being rewarded with good scoring, as The Beach Course continues its rise up the Australian golf rankings.,” Thirteenth Beach is unique in its two courses – The already famous Beach Course in the dunes has a strong and wonderful links character, whilst the second course has a feel of the very best of Melbourne’s sand belt through its gently rolling terrain and broadly separated fairways. There is a big choice to make here – which course will I play?”,Tony Cashmore – Leading Australian Course Designer, and designer of the critically acclaimed The Dunes Golf Links.,The Beach Course is unique in its design. Like many modern golf courses, The Beach Course features a large residential precinct. The first four holes play away from the clubhouse winding through the majority of houses. The fifth tee is the beginning of what Thirteenth Beach has become famous for, wonderful links land, rolling through a series of dramatic and natural golf holes that look and feel like they were there long before a golf development was planned.,But perhaps the key feature of The Beach Course is its wonderful set of par 3’s. Starting at the brutal 180m 3rd hole to the dainty yet sinister 113m 16th, the par threes of The Beach Course offer golfers of all levels a true test of their iron play, yet are mouth watering to the eye.,The Beach Course is a wonderful test of any golfer’s ability.

It is built on a stunning  piece of land that lends itself perfectly to the tradition of the famous  links courses of Britain and Ireland and can be compared favourably  with the courses in Melbourne’s famous sandbelt region.  Internationally  renowned golf course architect, Tom Doak is the designer of this  classic 18 hole links style course and his aim was to create one of the  best golf courses in the world.,As was the case with his other Australian masterpiece – Barnbougle  Dunes, Doak’s design philosophies and the nature of the land itself  provide a unique golfing experience with generous fairways and truly  spectacular greens.

It is one of the longest courses in Australia, and probably in the world in this category.,It measures 6783 metres, so it offers more than a casual stroll in the outdoors. It is a mighty and ferocious test of golfing ability, the likes of which even the top pros only occasionally experience. In terms of difficulty, I estimate a club-handicapped player would merit an extra eight strokes assistance to return a net par score, yet the course has great flexibility. It can be played at many different lengths depending on tees selected. Indeed, it is expected that the total length will only seldom be used for the real championship occasion. In addition to its condusive natural contours, the site is blessed with ever-present wind of some direction and strength, and this enhances its attributes. Planning has arranged that no particular direction is especially helpful, it is always a factor. The Leviathan of a course is a new experience for Australian golf.","Peter Thompson Drive, Rye, VIC 3941"
